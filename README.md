### Custom art


A file called `./art` will be created automatically with a template.
  * any non-whitespace char gets filled
  * the canvas is 7 in height (7 days)

### Optional: set default options

```sh
export GITHUB_USER='YOUR_GITHUB_USER'
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN='YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN'
export DRAW_START_DATE='2017-02-26'

```

### Notes

- Every time you run it it will delete (clears the graph) and create a repo called `gitkatt-child-repo` ([Example repo](https://github.com/KATT/gitkatt-child-repo)).
- The more layers you choose, the longer it'll run, & the darker your dots become.
