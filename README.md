## HOW?!? ðŸ˜»

### Setup

* [Create a personal API token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (with access to create/delete private repos)
* `git clone git@github.com:KATT/gitkatt.git`
* Update `./art`
  * any non-whitespace char gets filled
  * the canvas is 7 in height (7 days)
* Export env variables for the script to use
  ```sh
  export GITHUB_USER='<<<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>>>'
  export GITHUB_API_TOKEN='<<<YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN>>>'
  export DRAW_START_DATE='2017-02-26'
  ```
  `DRAW_START_DATE` is the top left corner of your painting (should be a Sunday, otherwise it'll get well weird)

### Run

Basically, the longer you let it run the darker your dots becomes. Every time you run it it will delete (clears the graph) and create a repo called `gitkatt-child-repo` ([Example repo](https://github.com/KATT/gitkatt-child-repo)).

```
npm start
```
